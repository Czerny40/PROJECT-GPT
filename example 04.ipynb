       "'Making Italian pasta from scratch is a rewarding process! Here’s a simple recipe for fresh pasta:\\n\\n### Ingredients:\\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour (or \"00\" flour for a more authentic texture)\\n- 3 large eggs\\n- A pinch of salt\\n- A little water (if needed)\\n\\n### Instructions:\\n\\n1. **Make the Dough:**\\n   - On a clean surface or in a large bowl, create a mound with the flour. Make a well in the center.\\n   - Crack the eggs into the well and add a pinch of salt.\\n   - Using a fork, beat the eggs gently, then gradually incorporate the flour from the edges of the well until the mixture is too stiff to mix with a fork.\\n\\n2. **Knead the Dough:**\\n   - Once the dough starts to come together, use your hands to knead it. Knead for about 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too dry, add a little water; if it\\'s too sticky, sprinkle with a bit more flour.\\n   - Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. This allows the gluten to relax.\\n\\n3. **Roll Out the Dough:**\\n   - After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions for easier handling.\\n   - Using a rolling pin or a pasta machine, roll out the dough to your desired thickness. For traditional pasta, aim for about 1/16 inch thick.\\n\\n4. **Cut the Pasta:**\\n   - Depending on the type of pasta you want, you can cut the rolled-out dough into various shapes:\\n     - For tagliatelle or fettuccine, roll the sheet loosely and slice it into strips.\\n     - For lasagna, cut into rectangles.\\n     - For ravioli, place filling between two sheets of pasta, seal, and cut into squares.\\n\\n5. **Cook the Pasta:**\\n   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fresh pasta and cook for 2-4 minutes, depending on the thickness. Fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta.\\n   - Taste a piece to check for doneness, then drain and toss with your favorite sauce.\\n\\n### Tips:\\n- You can add flavorings to the dough, such as spinach or beet puree, for colored pasta.\\n- Store any unused pasta in the refrigerator for a couple of days or freeze it for longer storage.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade Italian pasta!'"
